# Project 2:  Udacity Landing Page
## Description

Author: Abdulrahman Bin Rushud

Project 2 of the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree. From the course: 
This project requires you to create a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content added to the page.


I added or changed the following features/changes: 

* The navigation is dynamically built as an unordered list, When you scroll down the page, the current section is highlighted.
* When you click a link, the page will smoothly scroll to the appropriate section.
* The link to the current section is highlighted in the navigation bar.
* I changed the layout of the navigation bar for small screens (mobile) using flexbox. 
* I changed the colors of the existing background gradient animation.
